title: About

I remember the article by [Donald Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Francis_Roy) from my B-school days at Harvard.

But mostly I cherish the many "banana times" I have spent with colleagues -- "Smoke Break" is an alternate name given my current comrades...

This blog follows that style of informal thought experiments and observations, recalling Edsger Dijkstra, whom I met, and his [EWDs](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/).

Technically, the blog is based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com).
